"""Regression tests for the plugin-load dict race ("dictionary changed size during iteration").

Plugin loading runs on a deadline worker (``run_with_load_deadline``). A load that times out is
abandoned but keeps running, and its ``register()`` can re-enter discovery or simply land late —
writing ``_plugins`` from another thread while a reader iterates the live dict. That raised
RuntimeError inside ``PluginContext.has_plugin`` and surfaced as a *plugin* failure ("Failed to
load plugin 'openai'/'web-perplexity'") even though the plugin itself was fine (#132886).

These tests pin both halves of the fix:
  * readers go through ``snapshot_plugins()``, which copies under ``_plugins_lock``;
  * every ``_plugins`` mutation takes the same lock.
